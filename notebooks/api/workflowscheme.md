**ATTENTION** At this point of notebook execution you must get ensured that your Jira account does not already have a workflow scheme named "Notebook Workflow Scheme". Here you can find out how to navigate to the workflow schemes page inside your account: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Configuring+workflow+schemes. This action is to be performed manually as there is no way to list workflow schemes via REST.



Create a new workflow scheme. The body contains a representation of the new scheme. Values not passed are assumed to be set to their defaults



```javascript

issueTypes = client.issuetype.get().body

```

```javascript

workflowschemeCreateResponse = client.workflowscheme.post({

  "name" : "Notebook Workflow Scheme" ,

  "description" : "This workflow scheme was created by the API Notebook" ,

  "defaultWorkflow" : "jira" ,

  "issueTypeMappings" : {

    "3": "jira"

  }

})

```

```javascript

assert.equal( workflowschemeCreateResponse.status, 201 )

workflowSchemeId = workflowschemeCreateResponse.body.id

```



Returns the requested workflow scheme to the caller



```javascript

workflowschemeResponse = client.workflowscheme.id(workflowSchemeId).get()

```

```javascript

assert.equal( workflowschemeResponse.status, 200 )

```



Update the passed workflow scheme. The body of the request is a representation of the workflow scheme. Values not passed are assumed to indicate no change for that field. The passed representation can have its updateDraftIfNeeded flag set to true to indicate that the draft should be created and/or updated when the actual scheme cannot be edited (e.g. when the scheme is being used by a project). Values not appearing the body will not be touched



```javascript

workflowschemeUpdateResponse = client.workflowscheme.id(workflowSchemeId).put({

  "description" : workflowschemeResponse.body.description + " (upd)" ,

})

```

```javascript

assert.equal( workflowschemeUpdateResponse.status, 200 )

```



Return the default workflow from the passed workflow scheme



```javascript

defaultWorkflowResponse = client.workflowscheme.id(workflowSchemeId).default.get()

```

```javascript

assert.equal( defaultWorkflowResponse.status, 200 )

```



Set the default workflow for the passed workflow scheme. The passed representation can have its updateDraftIfNeeded flag set to true to indicate that the draft should be created/updated when the actual scheme cannot be edited



```javascript

defaultWorkflowSetResponse = client.workflowscheme.id(workflowSchemeId).default.put({

  "workflow" : "jira" ,

  "updateDraftIfNeeded" : false

})

```

```javascript

assert.equal( defaultWorkflowSetResponse.status, 200 )

```



Returns the issue type mapping for the passed workflow scheme



```javascript

issuetypeResponse = client.workflowscheme.id(workflowSchemeId).issuetype.issueType(1).get()

```

```javascript

assert.equal( issuetypeResponse.status, 200 )

```



Set the issue type mapping for the passed scheme. The passed representation can have its updateDraftIfNeeded flag set to true to indicate that the draft should be created/updated when the actual scheme cannot be edited



```javascript

issuetypeUpdateResponse = client.workflowscheme.id(workflowSchemeId).issuetype.issueType(1).put({

  "issueType" : "3" ,

  "workflow" : "jira" ,

  "updateDraftIfNeeded" : false

})

```

```javascript

assert.equal( issuetypeUpdateResponse.status, 200 )

```



Remove the specified issue type mapping from the scheme



```javascript

issuetypeDeleteResponse = client.workflowscheme.id(workflowSchemeId).issuetype.issueType(3).delete()

```

```javascript

assert.equal( issuetypeDeleteResponse.status, 200 )

```



Returns the workflow mappings or requested mapping to the caller for the passed scheme



```javascript

workflowResponse = client.workflowscheme.id(workflowSchemeId).workflow.get()

```

```javascript

assert.equal( workflowResponse.status, 200 )

```



Update the scheme to include the passed mapping. The body is a representation of the workflow mapping. Values not passed are assumed to indicate no change for that field. The passed representation can have its updateDraftIfNeeded flag set to true to indicate that the draft should be created/updated when the actual scheme cannot be edited



```javascript

workflowUpdateResponse = client.workflowscheme.id(workflowSchemeId).workflow.put({

  "workflow" : "jira" ,

  "updateDraftIfNeeded" : true

},{query:{"workflowName":"jira"}})

```

```javascript

assert.equal( workflowUpdateResponse.status, 200 )

```



Delete the passed workflow from the workflow scheme



```javascript

workflowDeleteResponse = client.workflowscheme.id(workflowSchemeId).workflow.delete({},{query:{"workflowName":"jira"}})

```

```javascript

assert.equal( workflowDeleteResponse.status, 200 )

```



Remove the default workflow from the passed workflow scheme



```javascript

defaultWorkflowDeleteResponse = client.workflowscheme.id(workflowSchemeId).default.delete()

```

```javascript

assert.equal( defaultWorkflowDeleteResponse.status, 200 )

```



**ATTENTION** At this point you must activate the created schema. A workflow scheme is considered active if it is associated with at least one project. Thus, we recommend to create a new project and associate the schema with it. See https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Activating+workflow#Activatingworkflow-associatingworkflowschemetoproject. This action is to be performed manually as there is no way to associate a workflow scheme with a project via REST.

```

```javascript

draftResponse = client.workflowscheme.id(workflowSchemeId).draft.get()

```

```javascript

assert.equal( draftResponse.status, 200 )

```javascript

defaultDraftPutResponse = client.workflowscheme.id(workflowSchemeId).draft.default.put({

  "workflow" : "jira" ,

  "updateDraftIfNeeded" : false

})

```

```javascript

assert.equal( defaultDraftPutResponse.status, 200 )

```



Remove the default workflow from the passed draft workflow scheme



```javascript

defaultDraftRemoveResponse = client.workflowscheme.id(workflowSchemeId).draft.default.delete()

```

```javascript

assert.equal( defaultDraftRemoveResponse.status, 200 )

```

```javascript

issuetypeResponse = client.workflowscheme.id(workflowSchemeId).draft.issuetype.issueType(1).get()

```

```javascript

assert.equal( issuetypeResponse.status, 200 )

```javascript

issuetypeSetResponse = client.workflowscheme.id(workflowSchemeId).draft.issuetype.issueType(1).put({

  "issueType" : 3 ,

  "workflow" : "jira" ,

  "updateDraftIfNeeded" : false

})

```

```javascript

assert.equal( issuetypeSetResponse.status, 200 )

```



Remove the specified issue type mapping from the draft scheme



```javascript

issuetypeDeleteResponse = client.workflowscheme.id(workflowSchemeId).draft.issuetype.issueType(1).delete()

```

```javascript

```

```javascript

assert.equal( draftDeleteResponse.status, 204 )

**ATTENTION** At this point you must deactivate the created schema as an active workflow schema can not be deleted. You may delete a project associated with the scheme or you may associate it with some other scheme.



```javascript
